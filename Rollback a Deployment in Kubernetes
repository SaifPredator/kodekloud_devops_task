Question : This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently on of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to roll back the recent release.

There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

1-List the available revisions of the deployment using the following command:
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
2-Identify the revision number you want to rollback to, in this case, the previous revision number.
3-Rollback the deployment to the previous revision using the following command:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=<previous-revision-number>
Replace <previous-revision-number> with the actual revision number you want to rollback to.

4-Verify the status of the deployment using the following command:
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
that's it your deployment nginx-deployment rolled-back to the previous version
