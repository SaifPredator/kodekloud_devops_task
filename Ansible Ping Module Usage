The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. 
Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. 
One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:
a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user on jump host.

b.Make appropriate changes on jump host so that user thor on jump host can SSH into App Server 2 through its respective sudo user. (for example tony for app server 1).

c. There is an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump host. 
Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 2, make sure ping works.


a. To enable password-less SSH access from the jump host to the App Server 2, you need to generate an SSH key pair for the thor user on the jump host. 
You can do this by running the following command as the thor user on the jump host:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for the key. You can leave it empty if you want.

b. Once you have generated the SSH key pair, you need to copy the public key to the appropriate sudo user on the App Server 2. 
You can do this using the following command:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tony@stapp02

c. Now that you have set up password-less SSH access, 
you can test Ansible ping from the jump host to App Server 2 using the inventory file located at /home/thor/ansible/inventory.
You can do this by running the following command:
ansible -i /home/thor/ansible/inventory stapp02 -m ping
Ansible should be able to connect to App Server 2 and successfully execute the ping module.
