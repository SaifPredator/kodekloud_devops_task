Question: The Nautilus DevOps team had a meeting with development team last week to discuss about some new requirements for an application deployment. Team is working on to setup a mariadb database server on Nautilus DB Server in Stratos Datacenter. They want to setup the same using Puppet. Below you can find more details about the requirements:

Create a puppet programming file ecommerce.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Define a class mysql_database in puppet programming code and perform below mentioned tasks:

Install package mariadb-server (whichever version is available by default in yum repo) on puppet agent node i.e on DB Server also start its service.

Create a database kodekloud_db2 , a database userkodekloud_roy and set passwordB4zNgHA7Ya for this new user also remember host should be localhost. Finally grant full permissions to this newly created user on newly created database.

Make sure to create single puppet programming file ecommerce.pp to do these all tasks.
