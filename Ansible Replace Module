    In this updated playbook, we have modified the file paths and string replacements in each task to match the requirements.

In the first task, we are replacing the string "xFusionCorp" with "Nautilus" in the file "/opt/data/blog.txt" on app server 1.

In the second task, we are replacing the string "Nautilus" with "KodeKloud" in the file "/opt/data/story.txt" on app server 2.

In the third task, we are replacing the string "KodeKloud" with "xFusionCorp Industries" in the file "/opt/data/media.txt" on app server 3.

Note that we have used the "when" condition in each task to ensure that the task is only executed on the relevant app server.
