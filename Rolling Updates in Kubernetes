We have an application running on Kubernetes cluster using nginx web server. 
The Nautilus application development team has pushed some of the latest changes and those changes need be deployed. 
The Nautilus DevOps team has created an image nginx:1.19 with the latest changes.
Perform a rolling update for this application and incorporate nginx:1.19 image. The deployment name is nginx-deployment

Make sure all pods are up and running after the update.
1-Check the current version of the nginx-deployment:
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
2-Update the nginx-deployment with the new image using the following command:
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.19 --record
The --record flag is used to keep track of the update for later reference.
3-Monitor the rolling update process by checking the status of the deployment:
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
4-Verify that all pods are running and using the new image:
kubectl get pods -A
