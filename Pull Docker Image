Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. 
As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features.
As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:
a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:blog.

Pull the "busybox:musl" image by running the following command:
docker pull busybox:musl

Once the image has been downloaded, re-tag it as "busybox:blog" using the docker tag command
docker tag busybox:musl busybox:blog

Verify that the new tag has been created by running the docker images command:
docker images
You should see the "busybox:blog" image listed along with its repository, tag, and other details.
