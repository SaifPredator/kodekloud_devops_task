Create a ReplicationController using httpd image, preferably with latest tag, and name it as httpd-replicationcontroller.

Labels app should be httpd_app, and labels type should be front-end. The container should be named as httpd-container and also make sure replica counts are 3.

All pods should be running state after deployment.
To create a ReplicationController using the httpd image with the latest tag and name it as httpd-replicationcontroller with the specified labels and container name, follow the steps below:

Create a file called httpd-replicationcontroller.yaml and add the following content:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: httpd-replicationcontroller
  labels:
    app: httpd_app
    type: front-end
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: httpd_app
    type: front-end
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd_app
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd-container
        image: httpd:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Save the file and run the following command to create the ReplicationController:
kubectl create -f httpd-replicationcontroller.yaml

This will create a ReplicationController named httpd-replicationcontroller with 3 replicas using the httpd:latest image, and with labels app: httpd_app and type: front-end. The container inside the pod will be named httpd-container and listen on port 80.

Once the ReplicationController is created, you can check the status of the pods using the following command:
kubectl get pods --selector=app=httpd_app,type=front-end

This should return a list of the pods managed by the ReplicationController, all of which should be in the Running state.
