Question :  The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repo /opt/cluster.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.

Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, add/commit the file and push to master branch.
 At 1st SCP index.html file from jump server to the storage server    

thor@jump_host ~$  sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -
Go to project repositories as per the task     
[root@ststor01 ~]# cd   /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
 Copy html file from tmp to repo 
[root@ststor01 cluster]#  cp /tmp/index.html  .
 Add and commit the index.html file  
[root@ststor01 cluster]# git add index.html
[root@ststor01 cluster]#  git commit -m "add index.html"
Finally push master branch to the origin.
[root@ststor01 cluster]# git push -u origin master
