One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only able to create the inventory, and due to other priorities that came in he must work on other tasks. Please pick up this task from where he left off and complete it. Below are more details about the task:


The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory seems to be having some issues; please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 3 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 3.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

1. Create a inventory file and add the app server as per your task

thor@jump_host /$ vi /home/thor/ansible/inventory                      

thor@jump_host /$ cat /home/thor/ansible/inventory

stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n   

thor@jump_host /$    

2. Create a Playbook file 


thor@jump_host /$vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml

thor@jump_host /$cat /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml

- name: Create file in appserver

  hosts: stapp03

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Create the file

      file:

        path: /tmp/file.txt

        state: touch



thor@jump_host /$ 

3.  Post file saved, run below command to execute the playbook

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory
