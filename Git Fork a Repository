You can also fork a repository using Git on the command line. Here are the steps:

First, navigate to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.
Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone <repository URL>
Replace <repository URL> with the URL you copied in step 2.

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the repository directory using the following command:
cd <repository name>
Run the following command to add a new remote URL for your forked repository:
git remote add fork <your forked repository URL>
Replace <your forked repository URL> with the URL for your forked repository.

Finally, push the changes to your forked repository using the following command:
git push fork <branch name>
Replace <branch name> with the name of the branch you want to push changes to.

Once you have completed these steps, you can make changes to your forked repository and push them to GitHub using the git push command.
When you're ready to share your changes with the original repository, you can submit a pull request.
