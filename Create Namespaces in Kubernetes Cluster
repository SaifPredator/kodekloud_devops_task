Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

To create a namespace named dev and a Pod named dev-nginx-pod with the nginx image using the latest tag, follow the steps below:

First, create the namespace using the following command:


kubectl create namespace dev
Create a YAML file named dev-nginx-pod.yaml with the following contents:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dev-nginx-pod
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
This YAML file specifies a Pod with a single container running the nginx image with the latest tag.

Apply the YAML file using the following command:

kubectl apply -f dev-nginx-pod.yaml
This command will create the Pod in the dev namespace.

You can verify that the Pod has been created by running the following command:


kubectl get pods -n dev
This will show the list of Pods in the dev namespace, which should include the dev-nginx-pod Pod that we just created.
