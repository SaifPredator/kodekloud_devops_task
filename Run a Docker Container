Nautilus DevOps team is testing some applications deployment on some of the application servers.
They need to deploy a nginx container on Application Server 1. Please complete the task as per details given below:
On Application Server 1 create a container named nginx_1 using image nginx with alpine tag and make sure container is in running state.
To create a container named nginx_1 using the nginx image with the alpine tag and make sure the container is in a running state, you can use the following command:

docker run --name nginx_1 -d nginx:alpine

This command creates a new container named nginx_1 with the nginx image and alpine tag, and runs it in the background (-d flag) to keep it running in a detached mode.

To confirm that the container is running, you can use the following command to list all running containers:

docker ps

This command will show a list of all running containers, and you should see the nginx_1 container in the list.
