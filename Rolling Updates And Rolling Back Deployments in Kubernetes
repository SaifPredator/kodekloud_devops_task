There is a production deployment planned for next week. 
The Nautilus DevOps team wants to test the deployment update and rollback on Dev environment first so that they can identify the risks in advance. 
Below you can find more details about the plan they want to execute.


Create a namespace xfusion.
Create a deployment called httpd-deploy under this new namespace, It should have one container called httpd, use httpd:2.4.27 image and 4 replicas. 
The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2. 
Also create a NodePort type service named httpd-service and expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008.

Now upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43 using a rolling update.

Finally, once all pods are updated undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version.

Step 1: Create a namespace called xfusion:
kubectl create namespace xfusion

Step 2: Create the deployment with httpd:2.4.27 image, 4 replicas, and RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1 and maxUnavailable=2:
kubectl create deployment httpd-deploy --image=httpd:2.4.27 --replicas=4 -n xfusion
kubectl patch deployment httpd-deploy -p '{"spec": {"strategy": {"type": "RollingUpdate", "rollingUpdate": {"maxSurge": 1, "maxUnavailable": 2}}}}' -n xfusion

Step 3: Create a NodePort type service named httpd-service to expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008:
kubectl expose deployment httpd-deploy --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=httpd-service --node-port=30008 -n xfusion

Step 4: Perform a rolling update to upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43:
kubectl set image deployment/httpd-deploy httpd=httpd:2.4.43 -n xfusion

Step 5: Wait for all pods to be updated to the new version:
kubectl get pods -n xfusion -l app=httpd-deploy

Ensure that all pods are in the "Running" state and ready.

Step 6: Once all pods are updated, undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/httpd-deploy -n xfusion

Kubernetes will automatically roll back the deployment to the previous/original version, 
and the rolling update process will start, reverting the pods to the previous version.
